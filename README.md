# A sampling approach for generating space-filling samples in invariant space using simulated annealing
A problem associated with training a mapping where inputs are principal and pseudo invariants of the right Cauchy-
Green deformation tensor, is that the sample placement in this space might not be spaced evenly even when sampling
the deformation tensors in a space-filling way. Furthermore, generating samples in a space-filling fashion in a specific
domain of the invariant space has not been sufficiently explored since it is not clear how to define a relevant region.

In [1] a method was proposed that uses simulated annealing to find space-filling samples in invariant space whose positions are constrained by a deformation gradient domain and physical constraints.

## Getting Started

Here we provide sampling algorithms for isotropic and trans. isotropic materials using MATLAB.
The algorithm can be started using the file runInvSampling.m


## Prerequisites

Matlab version R2017a or higher.
